<h1>Professional Interactive Web CV</h1>

This is the code for my web cv.<br>
Designed and developed from scratch using html, css, javascript<br>
The feedback block uses basic php to send mail of responses<br>
The fonts and images i have originally used i havent uploaded here<br>
The arrow movements are done using simple switch case js functions, using the onkeydown method<br>
The different pages are accessible using a plusSlides function on js which are called on keypress of right or left arrow keys<br>
The up keypress calls moreinfo() which shifts the page up displaying a new block with slideup animation with new info on every different subpage<br>
The down keypress calls about() which just displays the new block with slide down animation with same info regardless of which subpage you are currently on<br>
For smaller screens <900px just changed the width and height of the principle blocks<br>
For smaller screens <580px have replaced the arrow keys with arrow icons on edges of the page<br>
Imho this site is made to run on larger screens. Even though the site is responsive, its just not as impressive on smaller screens.<br>
The source code on the site is hexadecimal encrypted just cuz :D<br>
